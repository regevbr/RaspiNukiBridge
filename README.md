# Home Assistant Virtual Nuki Bridge

Use this instead of the [Nuki Bridge](https://nuki.io/en/bridge/) device.

> Important - if you are experiencing delays using RPI, it is advised to use a bluetooth dongle instead of the builtin bluetooth hardware.
> [TP-LINK UB400](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/usb-adapter/ub400/) is verified to be working.

## Background

- This is heavily inspired by the work of [Jandebeule](https://github.com/jandebeule/nukiPyBridge).
- Forked from [dauden1184](https://github.com/regevbr/) 's [RaspiNukiBridge](https://github.com/regevbr/RaspiNukiBridge)

## Add custom repository

[![Add repository on my Home Assistant][repository-badge]][repository-url]

If you want to do add the repository manually, please follow the procedure highlighted in the [Home Assistant website](https://home-assistant.io/hassio/installing_third_party_addons). Use the following URL to add this repository: https://github.com/regevbr/RaspiNukiBridge

## Install addon

1. Go to Home Assistant -> Configuration -> Add-ons, backups & Supervisor -> add-on store (in the bottom right corner)

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the Supervisor add-on store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_store.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/)

2. On the top right overflow menu â‹® click the "Check for updates" button
3. Install the addon. It takes a few minutes.
4. _Don't start it yet!_

# Pairing

1. Press the button of the Nuki Smart Lock for 6 seconds. It should light up.
2. Run

   1. If installed as addon, click `start`
   2. If installed outside HA, run

      `python .`

3. Look in logs for:

   ```
   ********************************************************************
   *                                                                  *
   *                         Pairing completed!                       *
   *                            Access Token                          *
   * abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabca *
   *                                                                  *
   ********************************************************************
   ```

4. Copy the `Access Token` for a following step.

   In case you missed it, restart the service and check again.

5. Before moving on, you might need to restart the addon. First run is less stable.

   1. [Official Home Assistant Nuki integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nuki/)
   2. [hass_nuki_ng](https://github.com/kvj/hass_nuki_ng)
2. Configure the Nuki Addon:
